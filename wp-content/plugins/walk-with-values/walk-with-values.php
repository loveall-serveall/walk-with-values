   Note for plug-in developers. 
     Some Model View Controller (MVC) development best practices:
     1. Create all the view pages (forms, charts, etc) in their own .php pages and
         just include them in this parent file.
     2. Individual view pages can in turn include references to model pages (functions, 
         database related code, etc) 
     3. The controllers (All the user facing pages) should have containers/ divs to hold 
         the elements (forms, charts, etc) defined in the view pages.
